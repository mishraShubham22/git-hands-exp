A project description is a foundational document that summarizes a project's purpose, goals, scope, stakeholders, timelines, and expected outcomes, acting as a blueprint for team alignment and stakeholder understanding, typically created early in the project lifecycle to define what needs to be done and why before delving into how. It provides clarity, sets expectations, defines boundaries (inclusions/exclusions), and facilitates communication for successful planning and execution, covering key elements like objectives, tasks, resources, and milestones
